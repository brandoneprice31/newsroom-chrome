# newsroom-chrome

Newsroom allows you to check what other sources are talking about the news article you're currently reading on Chrome.  In this era of "fake news" and biased news sources, we should always be reading from multiple sites rather than only getting our information from the same source.  Newsroom makes it quick and easy.  Not only this, Newsroom allows you to comment on what you're reading so that your voice can be heard and so that you can see what other people think about the article.
